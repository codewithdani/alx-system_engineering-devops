# Postmortem

## Issue Summary
- **Duration**: 
  - Start Time: October 10, 2023, 15:00 EAT
  - End Time: October 10, 2023, 17:30 EAT
- **Impact**: 
  - **Service**: Our primary e-commerce website
  - **User Experience**: Users experienced a complete service outage for 2.5 hours.
  - **Affected Users**: Approximately 30% of our user base was affected.

## Timeline
- **Detection Time**: October 10, 2023, 15:00 EAT
- **Detection Method**: Monitoring alert triggered due to a sudden spike in HTTP 500 errors.
- **Actions Taken**:
  - Investigated server logs and application logs.
  - Assumed it might be a code deployment issue.
- **Misleading Investigation Paths**:
  - Initially suspected a DDoS attack due to the sudden error spike.
  - Checked for database issues despite no evidence in logs.
- **Escalation**:
  - Incident was escalated to the DevOps team when the code deployment issue was ruled out.
- **Resolution**:
  - Identified that a recent misconfiguration in the load balancer. A routing rule intended for internal testing was mistakenly applied to the production environment, causing incoming requests to be directed to non-existent test servers. This led to HTTP 500 errors for users.
  - Rolled back the faulty configuration change in the load balancer.

## Root Cause and Resolution
- **Root Cause**:
  - The root cause was a recent misconfiguration in the load balancer. A routing rule intended for internal testing was mistakenly applied to the production environment, causing incoming requests to be directed to non-existent test servers. This led to HTTP 500 errors for users.
- **Resolution**:
  - We pulled a "Houdini" move by identifying the misconfigured routing rule and made it disappear faster than a rabbit in a magician's hat. We promptly rolled back the faulty configuration change, saving the day and restoring normal traffic flow to production servers. We also promised not to invite the misconfigured rule to any future magic shows.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures
1. **Load Balancer Configuration Audits**:
   - Create a load balancer configuration "No Entry" list – misconfigurations not allowed!
   - Implement automated checks to detect configuration anomalies. Our load balancer is too sensitive for any unexpected surprises.

2. **Deployment Verification**:
   - No more 'misdirection' – implement a step to verify the correctness of routing rules on the load balancer immediately after deployment. It's like double-checking that the rabbit is actually in the hat before the magic trick begins.

3. **Logging and Monitoring**:
   - Make load balancer configurations 'Great Again' with improved logging for better tracking. We're building an audit trail that even Sherlock Holmes would envy.
   - Set up additional monitoring alerts for sudden spikes in HTTP 500 errors – we're not just the IT department; we're the superheroes of tech.

4. **Disaster Recovery Plan**:
   - Create a comprehensive disaster recovery plan. It's our "Avengers Assemble" moment to ensure minimal downtime during outages and clear procedures for communication and incident response.

5. **Employee Training**:
   - Roll out mandatory training sessions. We’re upgrading our team's skills to superhero levels so they can spot the misconfigurations faster than a speeding bullet.

6. **Incident Response Improvement**:
   - Establish clear escalation paths and communication channels for incident response – when the bat-signal lights up, we'll know exactly what to do.

By implementing these corrective and preventative measures, we aim to minimize the likelihood of a similar outage in the future. We apologize for any inconvenience caused by the recent outage. Your feedback is invaluable in helping us provide a better user experience, and remember, even the most heroic superheroes sometimes trip over their capes. We appreciate your understanding and are committed to making our services as reliable.
