# Simple Web Stack

![Image of a simple web stack](0-simple_web_stack.png)


## Description

This is a simple web infrastructure that hosts a website that is reachable via `www.foobar.com`. There are no firewalls or SSL certificates for protecting the server's network. Each component (database, application server) has to share the resources (CPU, RAM, and SSD) provided by the server.

## Specifics About This Infrastructure

+ What a server is.<br/>A server is a computer hardware or software that provides services to other computers, which are usually referred to as *clients*.

+ The role of the domain name.<br/>To provide a human-friendly alias for an IP Address. For example, the domain name `www.foobar.com` is easier to recognize and remember than `8.8.8.8`. The IP address and domain name alias is mapped in the Domain Name System (DNS)

+ The type of DNS record `www` is in `www.foobar.com`.<br/>`www.foobar.com` uses an **A record**. This can be checked by running `dig www.foobar.com`.<br/>**Note:** the results might be different but for the infrastructure in this design, an **A** record is used.<br/>
<i>Address Mapping record (A Record)â€”also known as a DNS host record, stores a hostname and its corresponding IPv4 address.</i>

+ The role of the web server.<br/>The web server is a software/hardware that accepts requests via HTTP or secure HTTP (HTTPS) and responds with the content of the requested resource or an error messsage.

+ The role of the application server.<br/>To install, operate and host applications and associated services for end users, IT services and organizations and facilitates the hosting and delivery of high-end consumer or business applications

+ The role of the database.<br/>To maintain a collection of organized information that can easily be accessed, managed and updated

+ What the server uses to communicate with the client (computer of the user requesting the website).<br/>Communication between the client and the server occurs over the internet network through the TCP/IP protocol suite.

## Issues With This Infrastructure

+ Single Point Of Failure (SPOF) in this infrastructure.<br/>Since all components are hosted on a single server, if the server goes down or experiences any issues, the entire website becomes inaccessible. This single point of failure poses a significant risk to website availability. 

+ Downtime when maintenance needed.<br/>When performing maintenance tasks, such as deploying new code or updating the web server, the website might experience downtime. During this period, users won't be able to access the website.

+ Limited Scalability: .<br/>This setup won't be able to handle large amounts of incoming traffic. As traffic increases, the server may become overloaded, causing the website to slow down or crash.
